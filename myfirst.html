 <p> A family is a social group of people who stay together under the same roof in a society. It comprises two or more adults like parents and grandparents and young children who are bound in a relationship by birth or blood. They are collectively known as family members.

 	Families are important because they provide us with love, laughter and a sense of community. Your family understands your habits and knows the trials that you have been through throughout your life. Of course, sometimes your mannerisms can provide a little entertainment for the other members .
